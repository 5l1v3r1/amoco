Overview
========

Amoco is composed of 4 packages :ref:`arch <arch>`, :ref:`cas <cas>`,
`system <system_>`_ and `ui <ui_>`_, on top of which the
classes implemented in modules :mod:`code`, :mod:`cfg` and :mod:`main`
provide high-level abstractions of basic blocks, functions,
control flow graphs recovery and disassembling strategies.
